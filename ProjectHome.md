### First Toy: SlideShare Karaoke ###
We at SlideShare created this over the last weekend. Its a cool powerpoint mixer to select a powerpoint presentation on the fly from SlideShare. It uses the SlideShare.net API (and pretty effects by script.aculo.us and prototype.js) to select a random slideshow for a given tag.

It fetches only those slideshows that are released under the Creative Commons License and have allowed downloads of their slideshows.

Its hosted on SlideShare Toys / Karaoke
